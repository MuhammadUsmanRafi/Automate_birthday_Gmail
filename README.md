# Automate_birthday_Gmail
 Celebrate your loved ones' birthdays in style with this Python script! ðŸŽ‰  This script reads a CSV file containing the names, birth dates, and email addresses of individuals and sends a customized birthday message to those whose birthdays match today's date. It uses the datetime, random, and smtplib modules to generate the email message and send it via Gmail, and the pandas module to read and manipulate the CSV data.  The script selects a random birthday message template from three options and customizes it with the individual's name. It then logs into a Gmail account using SMTP, composes the birthday message email, and sends it to the individual's email address.  No need to manually send birthday wishes anymore! Let this script handle it for you automatically.     Muhammad Usman
